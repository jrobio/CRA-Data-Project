# CRA Data Project
My conference session is based on a project I undertook in August of 2018. The project was about efficiently finding a way to compare CRA's charity data to the BCIT's internal data. This project would have the following outcomes:

1. Identify Foundation that have given to other comparable charities in greater amounts
2. Identify Directors who are also alumni
